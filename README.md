### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

#####   ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m a modeling scientist, i.e.,
-      to collect and clean data and to analyze and model them,
-      in the traditional way or in the machine learning/deep learning way.
-      Simulations may also be engaged in the process.

#####   ðŸ”­ I love observing the world, and usually investigate it by
-      coding with `Python`,
-      based `Dlang`(if I have to write) and other libs.
-      on various `Linux` distributions.
