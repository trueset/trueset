### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m a modeling scientist, i.e., to collect and clean data and to analyze and model them, in the traditional way or in the machine learning/deep learning way.
- ðŸ”­ I was the principal investigator for a few projects on big-data analysis, large-scale optimization, and deep learning. Iâ€™m moving to financial markets now.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on an experienced stock and future trader, and an experienced trading platform programmer.

- ðŸ“« Feel free to raise the project issues.
